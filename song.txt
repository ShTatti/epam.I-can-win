So after all
You're new to me
So now we fall
Been used before
So after all
You're new to me
So now we fall
I'm low again
I've known within
There's more to know
Been searching toward
Been taking time
To lose my mind
It's hard to find
I'm losing time
Been used to find
Myself again
Just take me then
Or break me when
You Lose Your mind
I'm losing time
I swear I've tried
But now I've died
Been used before 
So after all 
You're new to me 
So now we fall 
Been used before 
So after all 
You're new to me 
So now we fall 
I'm low again 
I've known within 
There's more to know 
Been searching toward 
Been taking time 
To lose my mind 
It's hard to find 
I'm losing time 
Been used to find 
Myself again 
Just take me then 
Or break me when 
You Lose Your mind 
I'm losing time 
I swear I've tried 
But now I've died 
Been used 
Alone again 
I Hated Then
